# WinDO-finder

Tool to query for female members of public meetup groups.
It uses gender-guesser library to guess if the member is female, so the guess is not perfect but close enough.

Run it with python3 providing the name of the public meetup group (as it appears in meetup URLs) as parameter, like in the following example:

`python3 run Madrid-HashiCorp-User-Group`
